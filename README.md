# nudity_detection
Aiming to filter out NSFW content on an online platform, I was looking for a way to detect nudity in photos and videos using Python.

NudeNet appeared promising at first, but I had all sort of problems trying to use it, until I realized, as of this moment, NudeNet does not support TensorFlow 2 or Python 3.10.
Therefore, I managed to use NudeNet only with Python 3.7.9 and TensorFlow 1.15.
